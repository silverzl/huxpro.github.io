> Yet another man.


But dependence is ultimately undesirable.

The road still has to go by alone.

The passengers who talked and laughed at the pub could not move together.

Everyone has their own unique difficulties. If there is a person who can dependent on each other, it is already the luckiest thing in life.


We need to have hope, have goals, and see the path we have to go when one is struggling.

We need to be accompanied by a person who is struggling, perhaps with music, maybe anime, maybe reading.

Or maybe there is a person who walks with you in a blizzard, relying on mutual support, mutual understanding and encouragement. Together with hardships, together enjoy laughing .


Watching the sunrise between the forest and the sea at sunset; listening to the whispers of the wind, galloping across the vast grasslands; marching in the desert and boarding the highest snowy mountains;

Explore the true meaning of the world together and travel to the sea of ​​stars.


Let one road leave a pair of footprints, and the lonely cold wind becomes refreshing and open.

Mutual dependence, in the fall in the snow, someone helped. No longer afraid of the result.

But it will not stop its own pace, and will not change its original intention.


Perhaps the last point is difficult to achieve, and it may be difficult to meet in this life.

Maybe you will meet other people, one who will not explore the truth with me and go to the stars.

Maybe I will be with her like this, and then I will still go to the end.


However, the last thing I want to see is to pull me out of Blizzard and live in the seemingly beautiful hotel hotel. I will not embark on the journey in this life.


I have three wishes in this life.

Facing Blizzard, the future is clear.

Have music to accompany you.

Someone is moving with me.
